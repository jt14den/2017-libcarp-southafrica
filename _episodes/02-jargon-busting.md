> ## Jargon Busting
>
> This exercise is an opportunity to gain a firmer grasp on the concepts around data, code or software development in libraries.

1. We'll group you into breakout rooms of 3-4. Someone in your room should take notes in the etherpad.
1. Talk for **three minutes** (your instructor will be timing you!) on any terms, phrases, or ideas around code or software development in libraries that you've come across and perhaps feel you should know better.
1. Each group adds 3 terms, phrases or ideas to the class etherpad.
2. If time permits, feel free to provide definitions or explanations on other groups terms if you are knowledgeable about them. (The idea is we can build a glossary for the class).
1. The instructors will group the terms on the etherpad and facilitate a discussion about what we will cover today and where you can go for help on those things we won't cover.

> ## Busting Tips
>
> Often, workshop attendees ask if there is a handout of common terms and definitions as there is not enough time to explain all the terms in a jargon busting exercise. Many of the terms are covered in our lessons such as Application Programming Interface (API), regular expressions, terminal, git... but with so much [variation between our jargon busting sessions](https://twitter.com/search?q=jargon%20libcarpentry&src=typed_query&f=live), it is difficult to create a common handout. You can start with resources such as [TechTerms](https://techterms.com/category/technical) or the [Data Thesaurus](https://nnlm.gov/data/thesaurus) but you may also need to use the internet to explain terms. The [Sideways Dictionary](https://sidewaysdictionary.com) is another great place to get examples of jargon explained in plain English.
>
>
Keep in mind that our goal is not to explain all the terms we list out in the exercise, but instead to highlight how much jargon we use in our daily work and to come up with a shared understanding for a select number of jargon terms.
