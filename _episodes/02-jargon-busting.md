## Jargon Busting (Group Task)

### Erika Mias, Kayleigh Roos

1. Start by getting into groups of 5 or 6.
2. Next make a big list of all the problem terms, phrases, and ideas that come up. **Retain duplicates**.
3. Then (taking common words as a starting point) work together to try and explain what a term, phrase, or idea means (note: use both each other and the internet as a resource!). Make a note of those your group resolves and those you are still struggling with. **15 minutes**
4. Add your list of terms to the etherpad <http://pad.software-carpentry.org/berkeley-libcarp>
5. Report back on an issue resolved by your group **1 minute each**
