## Welcome to Library Carpentry!

### What is library carpentry?

* **Software and data skills** aimed at the needs and work requirements of library professionals.
* Training takes place in face 2 face workshops.
* Lessons are also made available online for self-directed study or adaptation
* Library Carpentry workshops have been taught around the world
* Teaches librarians:
  - how to automate repetitive, boring, error-prone tasks
  - create, maintain and analyse sustainable and reusable data
  - work effectively with IT and systems colleagues (most CS students in undergrad programs aren't going to be programmers)
  - better understand and use software in research

## Whys?

1. Role of librarian changed in last number of years
  1. online resources, outsourcing of library tasks (cataloging)
  2. People empowered to find resources themselves
  3. Endlesss reorgs and agnst in libraries
1. In research, academics don't need them to find information anymore
  1. increasingingly the info they want is in data they already have, or can get - so they want to clean up, analyse, mine, sift, manage and visualize that data -- librarians with data skills can have new role
