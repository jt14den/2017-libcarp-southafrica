## Welcome to Library Carpentry!

### What is library carpentry?

* **Software and data skills** aimed at the needs and work requirements of library professionals.
* Training takes place in face 2 face workshops.
* Lessons are also made available online for self-directed study or adaptation
* Lessons are open, you can adapt, remix or reuse
* Library Carpentry workshops have been taught around the world
* Teaches librarians:
  - how to automate repetitive, boring, error-prone tasks
  - create, maintain, work with and analyse sustainable and reusable data
  - work effectively with IT and systems colleagues (most CS students in undergrad programs aren't going to be programmers)
  - better understand and use software in research

## Whys?

1. Role of librarian changed in last number of years
  1. online resources, outsourcing of library tasks (cataloging)
  2. People empowered to find resources themselves
  3. Endlesss reorgs and agnst in libraries
1. Research has changed, more computationally derived, intensive, era data deluge - from sensors, the web and social media, simulations
  1. increasingingly the info they want is in data they already have or acquired, or can get - so they want to clean up, analyse, mine, sift, manage and visualize that data -- librarians with data skills can have new role

### Features of LC

1. Ending Pefection - YOU CAN DO THIS STuf
2. Code of Conduct - warm and welcoming environment
    - kill the "geek gene"
    - Myths of learning code are demotivating for many
