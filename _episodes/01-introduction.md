### Teaches librarians:
  - how to automate repetitive, boring, error-prone tasks
  - create, maintain, work with and analyse sustainable and reusable data
  - work effectively with IT and systems colleagues (most CS students in undergrad programs aren't going to be programmers)
  - better understand and use software in research

---

## Whys?

1. Role of librarian has changed:
  1. online resources, outsourcing of library tasks (cataloging)
  2. People empowered to find resources themselves
  3. Endless reorgs and agnst in libraries
1. Research has changed, more computationally derived, intensive, era data deluge - from sensors, the web and social media
  1. Increasingly the info needed is in data already possessed or acquired
  2. Need help cleaning up, analyzing, sifting, managing and visualizing that data -- librarians with data skills can have new role
